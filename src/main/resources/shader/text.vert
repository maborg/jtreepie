#version 330 core

/*
the main pipeline will work as follows

TERMS:
* glyph space: the space in which the beziers are defined
* em space: glyph space scaled by em scale. since this is the unit used to scale fonts normally, it standardizes size
* world space: the 3d space in which objects and models exist
* screen space: maps points to the screen in range (-1,1) on xy. the canonical opengl screen bounds.

* VERTEX
    * we are given the glyph, corner, and glyph space advance
    * find the box in glyph space
    * compute the box's center and find the corners
    * apply em scale to find vertices in em space
        - em space is standardized size
    * Apply pose, and mvp
        - pose maps the point from em space to 3d space
        - mvp maps the point from 3d space to screen space xy [-1, 1]
    * find delta from center to corner, normalize, double, add to corner (screenpoint)
    * pass screen point to frag and gl_Position
    * pass advance to frag
    * pass codepoint to frag

*FRAGMENT
    * we are given screen position, glyph advance, glyph, mvp, pose, viewport
    * compute min, max pos for pixel from viewport and screen pos
    * compute area.
        - For each bezier
            . shift over by advance
            . apply em scale
            . apply pose
            . apply mvp
            . compute area normally
